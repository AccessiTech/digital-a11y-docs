# Introduction to Digital Accessibility

Digital accessibility is the practice of designing and developing digital content and technology so that it can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.

The goal of digital accessibility is to ensure that all individuals have equal access to information and functionality on the web. This is not only a moral obligation, but it is also required by law in many countries including the United States.

This documentation covers a range of topics related to digital accessibility, including laws and regulations, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), common accessibility barriers and solutions, assistive technologies, inclusive design practices, accessibility testing and evaluation, user research and personas, case studies and examples, and additional resources and tools.
