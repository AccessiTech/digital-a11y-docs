# Accessibility and Universal Design

This document provides a brief overview of accessibility design and universal design, further reading is encouraged.

## Accessible Design vs Universal Design

While both accessible design and universal design are similar in that they both aim to make products and services accessible to all people, they differ in their approach.

### Accessible Design

Accessible design is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).

### Universal Design

Universal design is the design of products, devices, services, or environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The intent of universal design is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by as many people as possible at little or no extra cost. Universal design benefits people of all ages and abilities.

### Accessible and Universal Design

Neither design method is mutually exclusive, and both can be used in conjunction with each other to create a more inclusive product or service. For example, a website that is designed to be accessible to people with disabilities can also be designed to be usable by people of all ages and abilities.

## Universal Design Principles

The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University created a set of principles to guide the design of environments, products and communications. The principles, which are based on research in the field of environmental design, can be applied to evaluate existing designs, guide the design process and educate both designers and consumers about the characteristics of more usable and inclusive products and services.

### Equitable Use

The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

* Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.
* Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
* Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.

### Flexibility in Use

The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

* Provide choice in methods of use.
* Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.
* Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.

### Simple and Intuitive Use

Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

* Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
* Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
* Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
* Arrange information consistent with its importance.
* Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.

### Perceptible Information

The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

* Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
* Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
* Maximize "legibility" of essential information.
* Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).

### Tolerance for Error

The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

* Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
* Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
* Provide fail safe features.

### Low Physical Effort

The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

* Allow user to maintain a neutral body position.
* Minimize repetitive actions.
* Minimize sustained physical effort.

### Size and Space for Approach and Use

Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

* Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.
* Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
* Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.
* Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.
