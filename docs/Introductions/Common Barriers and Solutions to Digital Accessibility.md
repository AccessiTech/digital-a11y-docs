# Common Barriers and Solutions to Digital Accessibility

This document provides a brief overview common barriers to digital accessibility, further reading is encouraged.

## Visual Barriers

With a wide range of visual disabilities, such as low vision, color blindness, and total blindness, there is a broad spectrum of barriers to accessing digital content.

### Low Vision

Low vision is a degree uncorrectable loss of vision.

#### Solutions for Low Vision

* Magnifiable content
* High contrast content
* Optional simplified content layout

### Barriers for Low Vision

* Small text or fonts
* Insufficient color contrasts
* Loss of information when zooming into content

## Auditory Barriers

In addition to partial and complete loss of hearing, certain conditions / injuries involving audio centric regions of the brain can greatly affect the perception of sound.

### Deafness

Total or near total lost of hearing.

#### Solutions for Deafness

* Closed captioning
* Transcripts
* Visual cues for notifications

#### Barriers for Deafness

* Audio only content
* Videos without closed captioning
* Videos without transcripts

### Hard of Hearing

Mild to sever hearing loss.

#### Solutions for Hard of Hearing

* Audio controls
* Closed captioning
* Visual cues for notifications

### Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)

The inability interpret, organize, or analyze what's heard.

#### Solutions for APD

* Closed captioning
* Transcripts
* Audio and video playback speed controls

#### Barriers for APD

* Audio only content
* Videos without closed captioning
* Similar sounds for alerts and notifications

### Deaf-blindness

Deaf-blindness is a combination of hearing and vision loss.

#### Solutions for Deaf-blindness

* Refreshable Braille display friendly content
* Transcripts of audio and video content
* Haptic alerts and feedback

#### Barriers for Deaf-blindness

* Audio only content
* Videos without transcripts
* Missing or wrong HTML properties and attributes

## Speech Barriers

Speech impairments can be caused by a wide range of conditions and injuries, such as cerebral palsy, hearing loss, and/or brain injuries.

### Articulation

Impairments to speech caused by limited control of the muscles involved in speech, cognitive impairments that affect phonological processing, and/or the inability to make certain sounds past a certain age.

#### Solutions for Articulation

* Text alternatives for speech inputs
* Adaptive speech recognition

#### Barriers for Articulation

* Speech only inputs
* Speech to text without adaptive speech recognition

### Aphasia

Injury induced impairments to the ability to process language.

#### Solutions for Aphasia

* Skip back and forward controls for audio and video content
* Longer timeouts for timed content

#### Barriers for Aphasia

* Audio and video content without adequate playback controls
* Timed content and session timeouts

## Motor Barriers

Motor impairments can be caused by a wide range of conditions and injuries, such as arthritis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and/or brain injuries.

### Manual Dexterity

Impairments to the ability to use hands and fingers, such as the ability to use a mouse or keyboard.

#### Solutions for Manual Dexterity

* Keyboard friendly content
* Voice control and commands
* AI powered predictive text / code

#### Barriers for Manual Dexterity

* Small click / tap targets
* Keyboard inaccessible content
* Prolonged or repetitive actions

### Mobility

Impairments to the ability to move, including the ability to walk, reach, and/or grasp.

#### Solutions for Mobility

* Keyboard and assistive tech friendly content
* Voice control and commands
* Location / movement neutral content

#### Barriers for Mobility

* Inaccessible content, keyboard or otherwise
* Prolonged or repetitive actions
* Location / movement dependent content

### Coordination

Impairments to the ability to control fine motor movements, whether due to muscle fatigue, tremors, or other conditions.

#### Solutions for Coordination

* Keyboard and assistive tech friendly content
* Larger click / tap targets
* AI powered predictive text / code

#### Barriers for Coordination

* Small click / tap targets
* Inaccessible content, keyboard or otherwise
* Prolonged or repetitive actions

## Cognitive Barriers

Cognitive impairments can be caused by a wide range of conditions and injuries, such as autism, dyslexia, and/or brain injuries.

### Dyslexia

Impairments to the ability to read, write, and/or spell.

#### Solutions for Dyslexia

* Text to speech friendly content
* Text and font controls
* CAPTCHA security alternatives
* Highlightable and copyable content

#### Barriers for Dyslexia

* Content inappropriately formatted for AAC software / devices
