# Common Barriers and Solutions to Digital Accessibility

This document provides a brief overview common barriers to digital accessibility, further reading is encouraged.

## Visual Barriers

With a wide range of visual disabilities, such as low vision, color blindness, and total blindness, there is a broad spectrum of barriers to accessing digital content.

### Blindness

Blindness refers to the near or complete loss of vision.

#### Solutions for Blindness

* Screen reader friendly content
* Braille, tactile, and/or haptic feedback for device interfaces
* Audio readouts of pertinent information

#### Barriers for Blindness

* Missing alternate text on images
* Overly complicated or non-focusable navigation
* Missing or inappropriately labeled page elements
* Interactive `div` elements without proper ARIA attributes
* Videos without description audio tracks

### Color Blindness

Color blindness impairs a person's ability to distinguish certain colors.

#### Solutions for Color Blindness

* Inclusive color scheme design
* Color and contrast options
* Screen filters

#### Barriers for Color Blindness

* Color coded elements without alternate distinction
* Color schemes with similar colors
* Color schemes with `red/green` and/or `blue/yellow` combinations

### Low Vision

Low vision is a degree uncorrectable loss of vision.

#### Solutions for Low Vision

* Magnifiable content
* High contrast content
* Optional simplified content layout

### Barriers for Low Vision

* Small text or fonts
* Insufficient color contrasts
* Loss of information when zooming into content

## Auditory Barriers

In addition to partial and complete loss of hearing, certain conditions/injuries involving audio centric regions of the brain can greatly affect the perception of sound.

### Deafness

Total or near total lost of hearing.

#### Solutions for Deafness

* Closed captioning
* Transcripts
* Visual cues for notifications

#### Barriers for Deafness

* Audio only content
* Videos without closed captioning
* Videos without transcripts

### Hard of Hearing

Mild to sever hearing loss.

#### Solutions for Hard of Hearing

* Audio controls
* Closed captioning
* Visual cues for notifications

### Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)

The inability interpret, organize, or analyze what's heard.

#### Solutions for APD

* Closed captioning
* Transcripts
* Audio and video playback speed controls

#### Barriers for APD

* Audio only content
* Videos without closed captioning
* Similar sounds for alerts and notifications

### Deaf-blindness

Deaf-blindness is a combination of hearing and vision loss.

#### Solutions for Deaf-blindness

* Refreshable Braille display friendly content
* Transcripts of audio and video content
* Haptic alerts and feedback

#### Barriers for Deaf-blindness

* Audio only content
* Videos without transcripts
* Missing or wrong HTML properties and attributes

## Speech Barriers

Speech impairments can be caused by a wide range of conditions and injuries, such as cerebral palsy, hearing loss, and/or brain injuries.

### Articulation

Impairments to speech caused by limited control of the muscles involved in speech, cognitive impairments that affect phonological processing, and/or the inability to make certain sounds past a certain age.

#### Solutions for Articulation

* Text alternatives for speech inputs
* Adaptive speech recognition

#### Barriers for Articulation

* Speech only inputs
* Speech to text without adaptive speech recognition

### Aphasia

Injury induced impairments to the ability to process language.

#### Solutions for Aphasia

* Playback speed controls for audio and video content
* Skip back and forward controls for audio and video content
* Longer timeouts for timed content

#### Barriers for Aphasia

* Audio and video content without adequate playback controls
* Timed content and session timeouts
