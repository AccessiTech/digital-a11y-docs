# Introduction to Digital Accessibility

Digital accessibility is the practice of designing and developing digital content and technology so that it can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, neurological disabilities, and everyone else.

The goal of digital accessibility is to ensure that all individuals have equal access to information and functionality on the web. This is not only a moral obligation, but it is also required by law in many countries including the United States.

## Why Digital Accessibility is Important

Overall, digital accessibility is not only a moral obligation but also a legal requirement in many countries. By creating accessible digital experiences, businesses can promote inclusivity, comply with legal requirements, increase customer satisfaction, drive innovation, and gain a competitive advantage.

### Inclusivity

Digital accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use digital content. This promotes inclusivity and equal opportunities for all individuals.
